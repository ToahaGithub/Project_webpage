    <b><h2>1. OnePlus 7 Pro<br>The Best Flagship Value<br></h2></b>
<p>
    There's really very little to fault in the OnePlus 7 Pro. The display, camera, and core specs are essentially all best-in-class - or close enough to count - while the few shortcuts (wireless charging, an IP rating) are easily explained away by a price point - starting from $669 - that still undercuts the closest comparable rivals by some way. Yes, this costs a bit more than you're probably used to from OnePlus, but it delivers on enough of its promises to justify that price hike - and if you're not convinced, the regular OnePlus 7 is always there (outside the US at least), at the same ol' price OnePlus has been hitting for the last year or two. In a year that's already seen both Samsung and Huawei drop pretty phenomenal flagships, OnePlus has still managed to drop a device that might just be the phone to beat in 2019.

    <b><h2>2. Xiaomi Mi 9<br>The Flagship Killer<br></h2></b>

<p>
    There's a lot to like about the Xiaomi Mi 9, which offers some of the best specs you're likely to see in an Android flagship in 2019, and looks really good too - the thin bezels and teardrop notch put the focus on the bright, vivid 6.39-inch screen. When we tested out the phone we were also impressed with the Xiaomi Mi 9 camera, which got great results in most conditions, and the battery life. It's going to give some serious competition to Google and Samsung this year. There are some minor niggles worth talking about, including the lack of waterproofing and the MIUI software that Xiaomi puts on top of Android - it's not quite the polished software experience that you get from Google or Samsung. What really makes the Xiaomi Mi 9 stand out as one of the best Android phones of 2019, though, is the price: it's available for significantly less than the S10s and Pixel 3s of this world, and represents excellent value for money.

    <b><h2>3. Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus<br>The Best Overall Phone<br></h2></b>

<p>
    The Galaxy S10 Plus is the best Galaxy phone ever with outstanding cameras, build, display and performance. The Exynos version is let down by its merely acceptable battery life. It's also very expensive from $999 and then some, but it's a wonderful experience with OneUI's thoughtful additions, slick day to day use and more features than you can throw a stick at. If you want to spend $100 less there's the regular Galaxy S10 which has most of the same features including the triple rear cameras and outstanding screen. You could even go for the S10e, but it's a different phone with a smaller screen, less battery and fewer cameras.

    <b><h2>4.  iPhone XS Max<br>The Best Apple Phone<br></h2></b>

<p>
    The iPhone XS Max is the best phone money can buy. Granted, $1,099 is a lot of money, but for that price you're getting a ginormous and gorgeous 6.5-inch OLED display, much improved cameras (especially in low light) and the fastest processor ever in a phone. The regular iPhone XS has all of the same upgrades, but we prefer the Max for its larger canvas for watching video, split-screen view within certain apps and longer battery life.  If you're going to splurge on a phone to own for the next 2 to 3 years, this is it.

    <b><h2>5. Huawei P30 Pro<br>The Best Camera Phone<br></h2></b>

<p>
    The Huawei P30 Pro bears many similarities to the older P20 Pro but also to the Mate 20 Pro that sits below it in this chart. Huawei's software leaves a lot to be desired, but this phone excels with extraordinary cameras. With an amazing 10x optical zoom and outstanding low light performance the P30 Pro pushes Huawei firmly into the conversation. Battery life is also outstanding. It's the same price as the Galaxy S10 Plus at $899 and isn't available in the US but this is the best phone Huawei has ever made.

    <b><h2>6. Samsung Galaxy Note 9<br>The Best Big Phone<br></h2></b>

<p>
    The Note 9 takes the winning design of the Note 8 and improves it with better build quality, a larger screen and a sensibly placed fingerprint scanner. The 4000mAh battery is also an amazing upgrade. The display is the best you'll find on a smartphone alongside stereo speakers, great cameras and the smoothest Samsung software yet. It's too expensive for some starting at $999 and you might not need the S-Pen, but if its unique inclusion appeals to you then this is the best phone going.

    <b><h2>7. Sony Xperia 1<br>The Best Movie Phone<br></h2></b>

<p>
    The Xperia 1 looks wacky at first with its very tall 21:9 aspect ratio, but aping the dimensions of a cinema screen means many Netflix films looks absolutely stunning with no letterboxing or cut-off. It costs $949. The tallness is also handy in portrait though, letting you split screen apps - you can watch a video in the top third while using, say, maps or messaging in the bottom two thirds with enough screen space for neither to be cramped. With an industry-first notchless 4K HDR OLED display and much-improved cameras, Sony has made a phone that isn't for the mainstream but ties together the best the company has to offer in smartphone displays, video capture and video playback.

    <b><h2>8. Google Pixel 3 XL<br>The 2nd Best Camera Phone<br></h2></b>

<p>
    The Google Pixel 3 phones aren't a huge leap forward from the Pixel 2 models, but they are enough of an upgrade to warrant a place on our list of the best Android phones for 2019. The specs above refer to the larger Google Pixel 3 XL - if you prefer you can pay a little less money for the slightly smaller (and notch-free) Pixel 3 instead, as almost all the specs are the same. Inside the phones we have the Snapdragon 845 to keep everything ticking along nicely, while Google is now using a glass backing to enable wireless charging on the Pixels for the first time. Its traditional two-tone design is still in place though, with a textured finish that feels good in the hand. As in previous years though, it's the camera where the Pixel 3 and Pixel 3 XL really stand out: even though it's a single-lens model, it's capable of some fantastic shots, especially with upgrades like Night Sight for low light photography. It's perhaps the main reason you would pick the Pixel 3 as the best Android phone on the market. Another reason would be those speedy Android updates, straight from Google. There's no bloatware or extra Android skin here, so you're guaranteed a slick and intuitive software experience for years to come. Google's individual apps continue to impress too, though of course you can get them on any Android or iOS phone.

    <b><h2>9. Motorola moto Z4<br>The Best Budget Phone<br></h2></b>

<p>
    The Moto Z4 is not an exciting phone. It doesn't bring anything new to the table, and at $500, you can buy similarly-priced phones with more compelling features, like the Google Pixel 3a or the Asus ZenFone 6. That doesn't mean it's a bad phone. The Moto Z4 offers solid performance, a large battery, a promising camera, and a nice software experience. You can still use Moto Mods, and some are genuinely useful. But at the end of the day, the Z4 is priced a little high. You should only buy this phone if you're on Verizon's network, as it's available for $400 if you're an existing customer and you're upgrading (and even less if you're switching to Verizon).
